# Arduino-with-Matlab
A Matlab GUI to read moisture level from an arduino board
A resistive soil moisture sensor was connected to the analog input (A0) of an arduino board. 
The voltage levels for the various levels: no moisture and total moisture were read and this enabled a line equation relating moisture to percentage to be obtained.
